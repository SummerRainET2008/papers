\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a joint system on classification and  similarity  models with the multi-task learning.
It retains the high performance of a classification model, and also leverages the power of a similarity model that can utilize out-of-domain data.
Experiments show our systems are  especially suitable for  low-resource  short text  classification  tasks.
