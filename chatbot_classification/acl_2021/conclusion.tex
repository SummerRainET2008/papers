\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In  this  work,  we proposed SFC, a joint system of classification and  similarity  models with multi-task learning, 
to  alleviate  the  limitations  of  both models   for  low-resource  short text  classification  tasks, 
especially for the real-world applications of task-specific chatbot in few-shot setting.  
Experimental  results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods 
over several competitive baselines.
